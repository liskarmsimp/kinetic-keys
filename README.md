# movement-tetris
Play Tetr.io by moving around in front of your webcam; no hand usage required.

Current keybinds:
raise right/left arm for right/left arrow
tilt head right/left for x/z
raise right/left knee above waist for space/down arrow
cross knees (or just turn sideways) for shift

x, z, and space are locked, meaning that they will only press the key one time and will become pressable again once the activation condition has been desatisfied
